Typeclasees, laws and automated checks
======================================

This project demonstrates declaration of a basic typeclass, definition of a few instances for 
builtin and user-defined types, and usage of [ScalaCheck](http://scalacheck.org) for verification
that the instances satisfy certain laws, appropriate for the typeclass.
